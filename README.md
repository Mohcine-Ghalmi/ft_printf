## 🗣️ About:

## 🚀 What is ft_printf?

>_This project is pretty straight forward, recode the printf function.
The versatility of the printf function in C represents a great exercise in programming for us. This project is of moderate difficulty. It will enable you to discover variadic functions in C. The key to a successful ft_printf is a well-structured and good extensible code.


### Prototype
`int ft_printf(const char *, ...);`
### Description
>_Write a library that contains ft_printf, a function that will mimic the real printf.
### External functs.
`malloc`, `free`, `write`, `va_start`, `va_arg`, `va_copy`, `va_end`
